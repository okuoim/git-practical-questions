GIT PRACTICAL QUESTIONS:

2) Create a centralized repo (private) (GitHub.com) and push the code to the GitHub.com repo

3) make that repo public from private

4) create a file myfile.log and ignore the file 

5) push all the commits locally to GitHub.com

6) Create a new branch with the name -> mybranch
create 2 commits c1 and c2 in the mybranch

7) now what branch merge strategy you will follow 
Hint: push the code from branch to the GitHub ....then raise pull request

8) What is git merge and git rebase. Demonstrate to show the difference between these two .

9) how to delete the remote origin (locally)
